# COFFEE-SUBSCRIPTION-FORM
This HTML code is creating a web page for a coffee subscription form. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Document Structure:**
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type and version.
   - `<html lang="en">` defines the HTML document with English as the language.

2. **Head Section:**
   - `<head>` contains meta-information about the document.
   - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the character set to UTF-8.
   - `<title>` sets the title of the webpage.
   - `<link>` links an external stylesheet (styles.css) to the HTML document.

3. **Body Section:**
   - `<h1>` displays the main heading as "Coffee Subscription."
   - `<p>` provides a brief description of the form's purpose.
   - `<form>` starts the subscription form.
   - Inside the form:
      - Various input fields (`<input>`) for name, email, age, and a dropdown for selecting the user's generation.
      - Radio buttons (`<input type="radio">`) to rate the coffee.
      - Checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`) for selecting the preferred coffee delivery method (home delivery or pick up).
      - `<textarea>` allows users to provide suggestions.
      - A submit button (`<button>`) to submit the form.

4. **Overall:**
   - The form collects information such as name, email, age, generation, coffee rating, delivery preference, and user suggestions.
   - It has basic HTML structure, including labels and fieldsets for better organization.
   - JavaScript functionality and server-side processing (if any) are not included in this code; it's a static HTML form.
